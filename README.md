Using the Final_Solution.py file, initialize a Grid() object with an argument of the .bff file you would like to find the solution for. 
Call the Grid.output_solution() function and a filename-solution.txt file will be saved. The txt file will show a grid, and the key is as follows:

o: open spot 
A: Reflect Block
B: Opaque Block
C: Refract Block
